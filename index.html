      <br><br>  <h1>  <b>ANIMAL ABUSE</b></h1>
 <h2><b>Every 60 seconds, one animal suffers abuse. Close to 65% of all abused animals are dogs.<br>
      Every year, more than 10 million animals die from abuse in the US alone.<br>
 From 2008 to 2015, more than 80,000 Greyhounds became part of the racing industry.<br>
  Many times, when Asiatic elephants are captured in Thailand, handlers <br>
  use a technique known as the training crush, in which "handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger<br>
   and thirst to 'break' the elephants' spirit and make them submissive to their owners";
    moreover, handlers drive nails into the elephants' ears and feet.The practice of cruelty <br>
    to animals for divination purposes is found in ancient cultures,<br>
     some modern religions such as Santeria continue to do animal sacrifices for healing and other rituals. <br>
     Taghairm was performed by ancient Scots to summon devils.</h2></b></p>

    <h2>In 2018, US government statistics put the number of laboratory animals used in research at 780,070, an increase of 5.7% from 2017. <br>
        This includes both public and private institutions. These statistics do not include all animals as most mice, rats, and fish are not covered by the Animal Welfare Act – though they are<br>
        still covered by other regulations that protect animal welfare.<br>
         We also have not included the 122,717 animals which were kept in research facilities in 2018 but were not involved in any research studies.</h2>

    <h4><b><b>ADOPTION</b></b></h4>

    <h3>Pet animals add joy and happiness to our lives and homes. Pet lovers all across<br>
         the world will agree to this statement. Thus every home adopting a pet animal can be considered a noble thought. <br>
         Keeping pets at home helps you combat loneliness and at times pets become very closely associated with their masters and family members.<br>
          Pets at home are also a status symbol in society and are at man's service from the dawn of civilization from one generation to the other.</h3>

    <h1>IS ADOPTION BETTER THAN BUYING?</h1>
     <h3>The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them.<br>
         When you adopt, you save a loving animal by making them part of your<br>
         family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.</h3><br><br>
